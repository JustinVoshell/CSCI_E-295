X Add google-test to /redist
X Write, compile, and run a simple google-test that fails
X Write, compile, and run a set of tests that verify my integer constant handling
Separate out standalone scanner
	Use defines.. keep one scanner.l file
	Rename scanner_codes.h to tokens.h; move everything that isn't an actual token value to somewhere else
	Rethink use of code ranges- we won't have them when our tokens file is generated by bison
	We tell bison the constant values we want to use for tokens... so we can se ourselves up to use the same ones.
	We could even place ranges in a separate header and handle then there
	
Write scanner / parser for simple +, -, *, / expressions on LITERAL_NUMBERs
Fully scan / parse / pretty-print / test arithmetic expressions on IDENTIFIERs and LITERAL_NUMBERs
