To build type:

make 

or

make scanner



To run unit tests type (will build scanner if not already built):

make test


To clean (doesn't remove scanner executable):

make clean 

To clobber (removes lexer):

make clobber

                    CSCI-E295 Problem Set 1: Scanner
                    
===============================================================================

The program built from the source code here can be used to scan a program 
written in the subset of C89 used for CSCI-E295 ("the source language"). It 
will read the provided file (or standard input) and produce as output a stream 
of lines, each line representing a token in the source language.

Usage:
    scanner [<input>] [<output>]

Both the input filename and output filename are optional. If the input filename
is not specified or is given as '-', it is assumed to be stdin. If the output
filename is not specified or is given as '-', it is assumed to be stdout.

The input file should be a (lexically) valid source language program. Output 
consists of lines with tab separated fields:

line = <line-number>            the current line number in the source program

text = <text>                   the source text consumed

token = <token-type>            if the scanner found a valid token, one of:
                                    RESERVED_WORD, IDENTIFIER, OPERATOR, 
                                    NUMBER, STRING

error = SCANNING_ERROR          if the scanner did not find a valid token

word = <reserved-word>          an enumerated type indicating which reserved
                                word was found, if token-type = RESERVED_WORD
                                
id = <identifier>               a string representing the identifier found, if 
                                token-type = IDENTIFIER
                                
op = <operator>                 an enumerated type indicating which operator
                                was found, if token-type = OPERATOR
                                
type = <number_type>            an enumerated type indicating the size of 
                                integer constant found, if token-type = NUMBER
                                one of:
                                    INT_TYPE, LONG_TYPE, UNSIGNED_LONG_TYPE
                                character constants always have INT_TYPE
                                    
value = <integer>               the value of the integer constant, if 
                                token-type = NUMBER

error = OVERFLOW                if the number found was too large to fit in
                                UNSIGNED_LONG_TYPE, when token-type = NUMBER
                                
string = <string>               the value of the string constant, not including
                                the terminating NUL, if token-type = <STRING>

length = <length>               the length of the string constant, including
                                terminating NUL, if token-type = <STRING>
